## Release Process

This project uses automated release workflows with version bumping and GitHub releases.

### Creating a Release

#### Using NPM Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# For a patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
npm run version:patch

# For a minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
npm run version:minor

# For a major release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
npm run version:major

# Then push the changes and tags
git push origin main --tags
```

### Release Workflow

The release process automatically:

- ✅ Creates a git commit with the version bump
- ✅ Creates a git tag with the new version
- ✅ Pushes changes and tags to the repository
- ✅ Triggers the release workflow (on tag push)
- ✅ Builds the application
- ✅ Generates changelog from commits since last release
- ✅ Creates a GitHub release with dynamic changelog
- ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages (via existing deploy.yml workflow)

### Version Numbering

- **Patch** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **Minor** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features, enhancements
